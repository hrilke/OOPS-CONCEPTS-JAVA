Difference Between Abstract Class and Interfaces

Feature	                Abstract Class	                                                        Interface
Instantiation	        Cannot be instantiated on its own.	                        Cannot be instantiated on its own.
Method Implementation	Can have both abstract and concrete methods.	            Can only have abstract methods and default/static methods.
Inheritance	            Supports single class inheritance.	                        Supports multiple interface inheritance.
Constructor	            Can have constructors.	                                    Cannot have constructors.
Access Modifiers	    Can have access modifiers (public, protected, private).	    Methods are implicitly public.
Fields	                Can have fields.	                                        Cannot have fields.
Code Reusability	    Provides code reusability through inheritance.	            Provides code reusability through implementation.
Use Case	            Used when you want to define a common base for              Used when you want to define a contract for classes to
                        multiple subclasses and provide a default implementation.	implement, allowing for multiple implementations of the same contract.
