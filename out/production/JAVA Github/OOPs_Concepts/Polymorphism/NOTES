Polymorphism is Basically an ability of doing same thing in different ways i.e Multiple forms.

PPolymorphism in Java is mainly divided into two types.
    * Compile-time polymorphism
    * Runtime polymorphism
 -Compile-time polymorphism can be achieved by method overloading, and Runtime polymorphism can be achieved by method overriding.


Method Overloading : Compile-Time Polymorphism
    -Multiple Methods inside the same class with same Method name but
    different Number of parameters and sometimes same number of parameters in different orders.

Method Overriding : Runtime Polymorphism
    -Methods having exactly same method signatures belonging to Parent class and Child class helps in
     method overriding.
    -In other words,  an overridden child class method is called through its parent's reference. Then the method is
     evoked according to the type of object. In runtime, JVM figures out the object type and the method belonging to that object.
    -Runtime Polymorphism is only possible when the class are interrelated by th virtue of inheritance.
