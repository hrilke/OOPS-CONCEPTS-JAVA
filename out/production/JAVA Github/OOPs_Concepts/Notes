Why do programming languages exists ?
-> Programming language helps programmers express logic in machine understandable manner in order to solve business problems.

Why OOP language exits ?
-> Procedural programming language like C is a programming paradigm that uses sequence of steps to solve a problem.
-> OOP languages can replicate real world objects into programming considering its properties/attributes and behaviours/methods.
-> The structure of OOP language codebase enables more maintainable, readable codebase.

What is OOPs ?
-> OOPs is all about Achieving ABSTRACTION by implementing ENCAPSULATION, POLYMORPHISM and INHERITANCE(3 pillars).

    ~ ABSTRACTION : It is an process of hiding implementation from the user. User can interact with the process using input and outputs.
      Example. Car Engine: User may not know the internal working how engine starts, However User can push start button as an input
                           and engine start as an output. Here User do not care about internal working rather than starting a car.

What is Encapsulation ?
->  Encapsulation is a process of storing data members using object inside a class and to restrict access to the data stored by outside environment
    using access modifiers.

    Object is an instance of a class.  (Swift, Polo, WagonR)
    Class is a blueprint of a object.  (Blueprint of Car)

What are Access Modifiers ?
    1. Private : Accessible inside same class only.
    2. Default : Accessibly within same package.
    3. Protected : Accessible outside the package and inside child classes.
    4. Public : Accessible everywhere.

Whether Java call by value or call by reference ?
-> JAVA IS ALWAYS CALL BY VALUE.
    -> Objects are stored in HEAP memory.
        -> Primitive variables and reference variables are stored in stack.

    ~ call by value
        example: you transferred Rs 50 (value) to your wife for some purchase.
                 purchase will not affect your account in this case.

    ~call by Reference
        example: you allowed your wife to access your (reference) account for some purchase.
                 purchase will directly affect your account in this case.


Memory allocation behaviour in java data types:
    Primitive Data types : Both Primitive reference and value assigned to the variable is store inside stack.

    Non-Primitive Data Types : Reference Variables will go inside stack and store address pointing towards object in heap
                               and Object is stored inside heap with data members at the referenced address.
