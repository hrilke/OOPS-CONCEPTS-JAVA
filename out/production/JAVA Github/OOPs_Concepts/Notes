Why do programming languages exists ?
-> Programming language helps programmers express logic in machine understandable manner in order to solve business problems.

Why OOP language exits ?
-> Procedural programming language like C is a programming paradigm that uses sequence of steps to solve a problem.
-> OOP languages can replicate real world objects into programming considering its properties/attributes and behaviours/methods.
-> The structure of OOP language codebase enables more maintainable, readable codebase.

What is OOPs ?
-> OOPs is all about Achieving ABSTRACTION by implementing ENCAPSULATION, POLYMORPHISM and INHERITANCE(3 pillars).

    ~ ABSTRACTION : It is an process of hiding implementation from the user. User can interact with the process using input and outputs.
      Example. Car Engine: User may not know the internal working how engine starts, However User can push start button as an input
                           and engine start as an output. Here User do not care about internal working rather than starting a car.

What is Encapsulation ?
->  Encapsulation is a process of storing data members using object inside a class and to restrict access to the data stored by outside environment
    using access modifiers.

    Object is an instance of a class.  (Swift, Polo, WagonR)
    Class is a blueprint of a object.  (Blueprint of Car)

What are Access Modifiers ?
    1. Public : Accessible everywhere.
    2. Private : Accessible inside same class only.
    3. Default : Accessibly only
