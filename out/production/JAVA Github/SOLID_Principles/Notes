What are SOLID Principles ?
-> These are set of guidelines to follow

    S - Single Responsibility Principle
    O - Open Closed Principle
    L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    I - Interface Segregation Principle
    D - Dependency Inversion Principle


    ~ S - Single Responsibility Principle
        Every code unit  (class/ method/ block/ package) should always have exactly 1 responsibility.

        Ways to identify :
            Any Code unit having multiple responsibilities and if it does hold any business logic in that will imply in SRP violation.

            i) Method with multiple if/else statements.
           ii) Monster Methods.
          iii) Common utility packages.

    ~ O - Open Closed Principle
        Codebase should be Open for extensions but Closed for modification.
        Always add new features in your code, but never change existing part of code.
        In a nutshell, the developer must need to change only a specific part of the code (a class or a function) every time a requirement changes.

    ~ L - Liskov Substitution Principle
        We should be able to use object of any child class in place of parent reference variable without any special treatment.
        example : Bird b = new Pigeon();

    ~ I - Interface Segregation Principle
        We should follow SRP inside interfaces.
        Interface must have method or set of method that is collectively taking responsibility of only 1 task.
        example : A sparrow can run and fly both, So should implement both interfaces runnable and flyable independently.
                  If Sparrow implements RunnableAndFlyable in a single interface, this tends to ISP violation.

    ~ D - Dependency Inversion Principle
        Two concrete classes should never depend on each other directly, they may depend indirectly i.e. via abstract class/ Interface.
        In order to solve this problem we need to use Strategy Design Pattern.
