What are Streams ?
-> It is one of the major new feature introduced in java 8.
   It is a way to write more declarative code with minimal lines.
   It is used to process collection of objects.
   It involves sequence of methods performing a task by implementing method chaining.

How to create Stream ?
-> Collections : List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
                 Stream<Integer> stream = numbers.stream();

   Arrays : int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            IntStream stream = Arrays.stream(numbers);

   Stream.of :  Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

Types of Operations :

Intermediate Operations: These operations are used to transform the stream into another stream.
   They are lazy, which means that they are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked on the stream.
   Some examples of intermediate operations are filter(), map(), sorted(), distinct(), limit(), and skip().

Terminal Operations: These operations are used to produce a result from a stream.
   They are eager, which means that they are executed immediately. Some examples of terminal operations
   are forEach(), count(), collect(), reduce(), min(), max(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), and noneMatch().
