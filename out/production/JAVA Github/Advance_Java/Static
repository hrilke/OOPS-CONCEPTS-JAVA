Static Keyword : When applied to a class attribute or method,
                 it means that the attribute or method belongs to the class itself,
                 rather than to instances (objects) of the class.

static attribute : This attribute has only one instance across the objects of its class.
                   It can be accessed from the class as it is class level attribute.

static Method : This method belongs to the class can be called using class without an object.

static with Nested class : It is a class that is created inside a class. It can be accessed by outer class name.


Difference Between : Static Method and Instance Method

Feature	                    Static Method	                                            Instance Method
Invocation	    Invoked using class name (e.g., ClassName.method())	            Invoked using object instance (e.g., object.method())
Access	        Cannot access instance variables directly	                    Can access instance variables directly
Access	        Can access static variables directly	                        Can access static variables directly
Access	        Cannot use this keyword	                                        Can use this keyword to refer to the current object
Utility	        Typically used for operations not dependent on instance state	Typically used for operations dependent on instance state
Dependency	    Not tied to any particular instance	                            Operates on a specific instance
Usage	        Can be called without creating an object of the class	        Requires creation of an object to call the method
Memory	        Only one instance of the method exists in memory	            Each object has its own copy of the method
Overriding	    Cannot be overridden	                                        Can be overridden
Polymorphism	Not polymorphic	                                                Can exhibit polymorphic behavior when overridden
