What is constructor ?
    -> It is a piece of code inside a class which creates instance / object and initializes the attributes to the same object of that class.
    -> Java identifies constructor based on the attributes that are passed, and also in what sequence.
       How to identify : It has same name as class and without any return type.

Types of constructor :


    -> Default Constructor : Creates an object and Initializes Default values to attributes of that object.
                             (Comes with class)

    -> No argument constructor : Creates an object with some fixed values given inside body as the attributes.

    -> Parameterized Constructor : Creates an object and Initializes values derived from the input given.

    -> Copy Constructor : Creates an object and Initializes values derived form the object passed as an input.


Deep Copy VS Shallow Copy :
    Shallow copy : Two different reference variables pointing to the same object in heap, whose attributes are same.
                   there is no object creation happening while creating a shallow copy;
    Deep Copy : Two different reference variables pointing to two different objects in heap, whose attributes are same.
                It can be only created using constructor(new keyword).
