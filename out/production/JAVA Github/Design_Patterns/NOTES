What are Design Patterns ?


-> A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring
problem within a given context in software design. Design patterns are formalized
best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing
an application or system.

The concept was popularized by the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,"
written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
(often referred to as the "Gang of Four" or GoF), published in 1994.
