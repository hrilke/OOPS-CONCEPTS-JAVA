What is Singleton Design Pattern ?
-> Singleton Design Pattern is creational design pattern that restricts instantiation of a class to a Single Object.

When to use ?
-> It is used when we need to enforce single object to be created.

How to implement Singleton DP ?
-> 1. Constructor Hiding : Make constructor Private to restrict object creation from outside.

   2. Shared Instance : Create a class level variable that holds the single instance of the class.

   3. Global Access Point : Implement a class level method to instantiate the object if doesn't exists
      or return the object stored in class level variable that exists.

   4. Avoid Synchronization problem : While Implementing above method we need to use Synchronised and
      Double-Checked Locking to make it thread safe.
