What is Builder DP ?
-> Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.

When to use ?
-> 1) In case of instantiating complex object having multiple parameters.
      Can be used instead of Telescoping constructor anti-patterns.
   2) When Immutable objects need to be created.
   3) In case of a need to validate parameters before constructing the object.

How to Implement ?
-> Step 1.1 Create static inner class termed as builder class with all necessary parameters of Outer class.
        1.2 Implement Setter Methods that sets the parameter & returns the same builder object.
        1.3 Implement validation methods if necessary.
        1.4 Implement build() method and invoke validation methods before returning new Outer class Object.

   Step 2.1 Implement private parameterized Constructor for Outer class that takes builder class object as parameter.
        2.2 Implement static Outer class method that return new builder object.

   Step 3 Method Chaining: While Creation of the complex object Call class level method builder() and
          chain with setter methods of necessary parameter and finally build() method.

* Static Nested Classes: When you declare a nested class as static, it becomes a static nested class.
    This means that it's associated with the outer class itself rather than with instances of the outer class.
    You can access a static nested class using the syntax OuterClass.StaticNestedClass.

* Chained Method Calls: The builder pattern often utilizes chained method calls (also known as method chaining)
    to set the attributes of the object being built. This makes the code more readable and fluent.
