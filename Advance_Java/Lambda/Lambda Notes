What is Lambda Expression ?
->  A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous function a function without a name
    that can be passed around as a parameter to other methods or stored in variables.
    It provides a way to write more readable and maintainable code by reducing boilerplate code when working with
    functional interfaces.

When to use ?
-> Lambda expressions are primarily used with functional interfaces,
   which are interfaces with a single abstract method.
   They provide a way to pass behavior as data, enabling a more functional programming style in Java.

How to Implement ?
->
   Lambda expressions consist of the following parts:

   Parameters:
   No Parameters : Empty Parenthesis () ->
   1 Parameter : No Parenthesis param ->
   Multiple Parameters : Comma separated inside Parenthesis (param1, param2) ->

   Arrow Operator (->):
   This separates the parameter list from the body of the lambda expression.
   It's read as "goes to" or "maps to".

   Body: This is the implementation of the lambda expression.
   It can be a single expression or a block of code enclosed within curly braces {}.
