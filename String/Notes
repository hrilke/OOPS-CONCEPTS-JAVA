Strings are immutable in JAVA : Thumb Rule
    WHY : Memory optimization, to avoid duplication
    WHERE : Saved in String pool
    HOW : Same unique string will be used by multiple reference variables.

    ## Once String created cannot be modified, instead new String will be created inside String pool.
    Forcefully SHALLOW copied if same String created with new reference variable.
